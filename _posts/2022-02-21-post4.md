<br/>
<br/>
Aviators in the 2000s
3 decades after Vietnam
July '01 at the Center
60 days, Khan tera naam

Lufthansa tumult of past
Colors united yet at odds
Christmas '04 saturated with joy
12 hours, liquid death and loss

Daughter-daughter adolescence
Flat purchase, fresh price
Son-son adolescence
350 km west shall suffice

Gen-gen below in Pan-Am
SEF volunteering, commutes by bus
Dengue survived, a summer eclipse
The last common air breathed between us

Elder and wiser, your memory lives on
The unforgettable chirp of the doorbell
In pixels, in melodies
Your greeting's energy befitting a farewell



<h3 id="heading2">@KK</h3>:
<br/>
<br/>
With power comes responsibility
With composure comes intent
The ability to stretch a quadricep
The desire to construct a tent

The freedom to run a business
The encouragement to run a mile
The ability to accompany a sister
Injured, impaired, immobile

Golf was the passion
It saw the last breath
A deep loss in deed
A calm optimal peace Seth
