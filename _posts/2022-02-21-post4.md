<br/>
<br/>
Aviators in the 2000s<br/>
3 decades after Vietnam<br/>
July '01 at the Center<br/>
60 days, Khan tera naam

Lufthansa tumult of past<br/>
Colors united yet at odds<br/>
Christmas '04 saturated with joy<br/>
12 hours, liquid death and loss

Daughter-daughter adolescence<br/>
Flat purchase, fresh price<br/>
Son-son adolescence<br/>
350 km west shall suffice

Gen-gen below in Pan-Am<br/>
SEF volunteering, commutes by bus<br/>
Dengue survived, a summer eclipse<br/>
The last common air breathed between us

Elder and wiser, your memory lives on<br/>
The unforgettable chirp of the doorbell<br/>
In pixels, in melodies<br/>
Your greeting's energy befitting a farewell



<h3 id="heading2">@KK:</h3>
<br/>
<br/>
With power comes responsibility<br/>
With composure comes intent<br/>
The ability to stretch a quadricep<br/>
The desire to construct a tent

The freedom to run a business<br/>
The encouragement to run a mile<br/>
The ability to accompany a sister<br/>
Injured, impaired, immobile

Golf was the passion<br/>
It saw the last breath<br/>
A deep loss in deed<br/>
A calm optimal peace Seth
