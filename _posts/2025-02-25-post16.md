Anyone that knows me knows that Breaking Bad ranks as one of my favorite pieces of art ever created. Recitation ability of certain episodes of the last 3 seasons of the show may or may not be a part of my arsenal.

I had to visit the famed house (which is now on the market for $4M+), and ended up making a quick trip to ABQ for less than 36 hours. On the 28th, I had the chance to meet up with my friend N, and I had the opportunity nerd out heavily at the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History, followed by visiting the Breaking Bad house, trying out what may be the only Vietnamese restaurant in ABQ (though the Banh Mi was delicious), watching Mufasa in theaters, and grabbing a delicious fennel sausage pizza at Farina Pizzeria and Wine Bar in Downtown. I would never live in Albuquerque (and will unlikely ever visit again), but I had to pay my respects to Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. With regards to Santa Fe, on the other hand, I could be convinced.
