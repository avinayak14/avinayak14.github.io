It had been a while since I'd been in Northern Virginia (5 days), so it was nice to have the opportunity to travel to the DMV area for the weekend for NS+AM's wedding, and stay at A Aunty's place for the weekend. After watching Top Gun on the plane ride over, I reached in the night to pick up the rental car, and then headed over to McLean

Friday didn't have any events during the daytime, so I spent the morning working from home and then went to a cafe in Bethesda named maman for a few meetings. After arriving back, I headed over to the Sangeet at Rose Hill Manor, and there were a potpourri of delicious dishes! The catering was performed by Silk Banquet in Leesburg which was used by some of my friends for their wedding earlier in 2025, and has plenty of local Leesburg weddings that it caters for every year.
